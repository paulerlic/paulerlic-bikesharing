## Analysis Overview:
Hello and welcome to the bike sharing analysis, the goal of this analysis is to determine if a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We will use Tableau as means to convey this information to stake holders who are involved with this project. We chose tableau becuase there is alot of information to convey to the steak holders. Tableau is an easy to use tool that can be used to create powerful visulizations from large complex sets of data. We will be analyzing data from Citi bike ridership in NYC, some fields include trip duration, customer type, gender of the rider, and a several other fields.

## Dashboard
I highly recomend going straight to the dashboard linked below if you are just looking for the broadstrokes. However if data analysis and graphs are your thing scroll down and check out the detailed analysis below.

    -Our first graph takes a look at trip duration, and reveals some very interesting trends. The overwhelming majority of rides lasted less than an hour, in fact almost all rides were less than half an hour and if we look closley at the top of the graph most rides lasted only 5 minutes. This indicates that citibike riders are using the bikes for relativley short trips, this most likley means that the majority of citibike riders do in fact live in NYC. I think you would hard pressed to find someone who could cycle out of NYC in five minutes. Great the rides are short so what? If the rides are short this could mean that people are using the bikes for commuting to and from work but lets not get ahead of ourselves here.

    - Up next we have a heatmap showing the times when rides ended and bikes were parked back in the bike rack. We can see that on weekdays between the hours of 6am - 9 am and between the hours of 4pm - 7pm there is a significant number of rides relative to the rest of the hours in the day. This tells me that riders are most likley using the bikes to commute to and from work. We can also that on the weekends ridership increases in what I like to call the leisure hours of the day 10 am - 6pm, we could assume from this information that people like to ride citibikes on the weekend as a way to get out and enjoy the city.

    - Our third visulization is similar to the first chart we looked at but here we have drilled down into the ride duration and number of rides and added in the gender of riders. What we see is that a large portion of riders are male, we can also see that the trip duration remained fairly constant regardless of gender. So if you are going to build a marketing plan around launching city bikes in Des Moines it should probably be aimed at a male population as they represent a majority of the customer base.

    - Next we have pie chart showing the breakdown of customers by gender, and this pie chart lines up with the results from the visual above in the fact that a majority of citi bike riders are male. Why male riders make up the majority of the customer base is unclear at this point, but surveying the citibike riders may lend some insight as to why this.   
     * Customer Gender: 
     Male = 65.28%
     Female = 25.10%
     Unknown = 9.62%

    - Here we have another pie chart this time showing the percent of riders who are subscribers to citibike service and those who are not (Customer). We see that 81.07 % of riders are subscribers and 18.93% of riders are not subscribers. This is a really positive indicator that the citibike program is succesful, repeat customers are key to creating any sustainable business and.

    - Again we have a heat map showing start stop time of rides but this time we plotted the start stop times and seperated them by gender. This heat map lines up with our previous charts and indicates that riders are most likley using these bikes to commute and that males are the predeominant users of the citibike program.

    - Lastly we have a chart displaying the gender of the rider, the day of the rides, and the number of rides on those days. We again see the same gender trends as before, but we can also see that subscribers are in fact riding the bikes more often than customers who are not subscribers. 


# Summary
Our analysis of citibike ridership in NYC has provided us with some very useful data on the frequency of rides. Our analysis indicates that a majority of riders are most likley using citibikes to commute to and from work, and that the bikes also get used on the weekends for what we can assume to be leisurely prupouses. We know from our analysis that most rides are short right around five minutes. Addtionally we know that most of the customer base are repeat customers because they are subscribed to the city bike service.  

So what does all of this mean for Des Moines? It means that the citibike program has largley been successful in NYC. Quick turnover of bikes, a high percentage of repeat customers and predictable use times of the bikes means that the program is stable and thriving in NYC. At first glance this report would indicate that starting a citibike style program in Des Moines would most likley be succesful, however there are a few things to consider before jumping into such a a large project. Some additional visulizations would be required to really understand if this program is a good fit for Des Moines. 

    * I would like to do analysis comparing the dollars spent by subscribers vs non subscribed customers. This would allow us to determine if subscribed customers help generate more revenue than their counterparts and could determine if a program should be put in place to incentivize one group of customers over the other based off of how much they spend.
    * Another analysis that could provide us with useful information is focused around the weekends. It would be interesting to look at trip durations during the weekends to help us determine if riders are using the bikes for longer periods of time compared to rides on weekdays. If rides are longer on weekends this could be an area of focus for the development of the program. Longer rides = more revenue and if this program is deployed in Des Moines perhaps there could be a way to encourage riders to take more rides on the weekend as a way to increase revenues.
    * Another thing to consider is that layout and population of the city of Des Moines, NYC is considered a bike friendly city with a grid layout and lots of infrastructure in place for bike riders i.e* bike lanes, parks, and laws that protect cyclists in the city. Does Des Moines have these in place already and does Des Moines have a large enough population to support a bike sharing program?
